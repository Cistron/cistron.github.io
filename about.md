Howdy!

My name is Michael Baron and I used to be a senior teaching fellow at UCL in the department of structural and molecular biology.

I probably have way too many interests for my own good, such as metabolism, nutrition & obesity, microbiomes, data analysis and science communication.

## A very brief CV

More on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/drmbaron/).

### Work
2015-2020 Teaching Fellow (UCL)
: I taught a mix of molecular and microbiology (16S rRNA marker gene sequencing), seasoned with a bit of Python, Supercomputers, Science visualisation & communication.

2013-2015 Post-Doc (UCL)
: A brief stint in a molecular/pharmacological laboratory.

Summers of my youth
: Lots and lots of internships. The most peculiar probably in a waste recycling plant in Vienna.

### Education
2012-2014 MSc in Bioinformatics and Systems Biology (Birkbeck College)
: I clearly did this the wrong way round. I just got more interested in data and computational biology _after_ my PhD.

2008-2012 PhD in Developmental Biology (UCL Institute of Child Health)
: I transplanted photoreceptors in mouse models (and was the first to ever transplant a cone), as an approach to treat loss of vision.

2004-2007 BSc in Biochemistry (UCL)
: Probably more of a molecular biology degree.

1998-2003 Vocational High School for Chemistry
: I've been in and out of labs since the tender age of 14.

## My CV of my failures

I probably (hopefully) forgot a lot of them.

* 1984: I was born a middle child (well, technically, my younger sister made me the middle child)
* 1994: I had to attend the same school as my older brother
* 1998: I failed to voice my interest in computers and ended up in a chemistry-focused high school
* 2003: My application to MIT was late and hence ignored
* 2003: I was rejected from Imperial College and Oxford for undergraduate degrees (despite pristine A-level equivalents, without interviews)
* 2005: I foolishly signed up for a course on "bio-business plans", which I _barely_ passed (probably cost me the faculty medal)
* 2007: I only achieved 2.5 out of 6 points on the GRE writing task (I had _no_ clue about the marking guidelines for their essays)
* 2007: I told a (mature) student friend about the Cold Spring Habor Laboratories graduate programme (when Watson wasn't a pariah yet) - we both went for interviews, he got accepted, I wasn't (now he's nowhere to be found)
* 2007: I was rejected from MIT, Berkeley, Harvard, CalTech, Standford graduate programmes
* 2007: My favourite PhD project on atherosclerosis, lipo-proteins and gene therapy wasn't funded
* 2008: I produced my first bloody-awful science poster
* 2010: The first author position of my paper was passed to a Post-Doc (well, it was shared, but his name was listed first, as he had "more experience")
* 2010: My paper was rejected from PNAS
* 2010: My paper was rejected from Human Molecular Genetics (though later accepted)
* 2011: I struggled with the culture and differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells for half a year, with no results to show
* 2012: I was rejected from a Bogue Fellowship, which would have allowed me to work in a research lab in Memphis for a while (not enough time left in the PhD)
* 2012: I only figured out _after_ my PhD that I'm not made for hours of lab-work and much more prefer the computational aspects of science.
* 2012: I rejected the Post-Doc position in my PhD-lab (I wrote the grant)
* 2012: I applied for about 15 post-doctoral positions, had 15 interviews, yet secured none of them (changing fields is not easy).
* 2012: I failed to get jobs at McKinsey, Bain and BCG (at the latter at least I had an interview), several tech-focused companies and various medical writing/advertising firms.
* 2013: I picked an MSc research project in systems biology, which turned out to be more of a bug-hunting exercise in MATLAB (instead of a likely more promsing project on gene admixture)
* 2015: My call for funding for a MOOC on the history of molecular biology was rejected
* 2016: I failed to get an online weight loss programme successfully to market (instead of doubling down, the effort fizzled out)
* 2018: I was told to wait for another year before submitting my promotion documents for senior teaching fellow (not that much changed)
* 2018: I was rejected from Imperial College again (this time as Senior Teaching Fellow)
* 2019: I had to shut down a start-up on science education I had founded with some colleagues (not enough time, not enough focus, wrong mix of people)
* 2019: I got divorced (though maybe the marriage was the mistake ...)
