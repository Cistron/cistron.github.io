Howdy!

My name is Michael Baron and I'm a teaching fellow at UCL in the department of structural and molecular biology.

I probably have way too many interests for my own good, reaching from aspects of practical teaching to bioinformatics and pedagogy in higher education.

This little website contains information for my students and might at some point be used to publish my musings about teaching.
