title: A checklist for better figures
---

* Identify your message
    * Convey a clear message: express an idea, introduce some facts, introduce a result, aid in the understanding of complex material
    * Information that would be too long or nearly impossible to explain with words
    * “As for a picture, if it isn’t worth a thousand words, to hell with it” (Ad Reinhard)
* Know your audience
    * Level of knowledge: laymen, students, experts, mixed (e.g. public)
    * Size: large, small
    * State of your audience: Is it your stressed professor marking 100 pieces of course work?
* Adapt to the medium
    * Resolution, size: paper, poster, projector (aspect ratio), screen
    * Timing also determines content: less time to absorb information in a talk
    * Technological novelties: Zoom & drag
    * Beware of Turnitin’s resolution limitation
* Captions, legends and labels
    * Captions explain how to interpret/read the figure, just like the explanation you would provide during an oral presentation
    * Labels may be numbers or highlight important features: size & legibility, does it distract/obscure the data?
    * If possible, use labels over legends
    * Spell out abbreviations, if possible avoid
    * Keep text horizontal, avoid all uppercase, serif fonts are easier to read
* Use colour effectively
    * Use colour sparingly to enhance/highlight a particular aspect
    * Colour can construe, by default stay with black/greyscales
    * Be aware of colour blindness: avoid green/red, blue is ok
    * Colour might not print well (in particular greens)
* Don’t mislead the reader
    * Cropped, rescaled, inverted axes
    * Always use the simplest form of representation (which often means a table will do just fine)
    * Avoid pie-charts and most area-chart, as areas are hard to judge
* Chart junk
    * Avoid: 3D, too many colours and gradients, excessive labels, useless/excessive gridlines, patterned or colourful backgrounds
    * Chart junk increases processing time by the reader
    * Maximise your data ink usage
* It doesn’t have to be absolutely beautiful
    * Content over style
    * However, don’t be sloppy/lazy: put at least equal (if not more) effort into making your figures, by comparison to writing your text
* Software
    * Inkscape/Illustrator for vector graphics
    * GIMP/Photoshop for rasterised images
    * Color Oracle (http://colororacle.org/)
